Use given Iris dataset and solve the following questions:

1.show the count of different types of species
2.find the max,m and mean in values of Sepallength, petallength, sepalwidth and petalwidth
draw a graph:
3.scatterplot(for sepallength and petallength)
4.bargraph
5.jointplot(for sepallength and sepalwidth)
6.facetgrid(for sepallength and sepalwidth for all species)
7.boxplot(for species and sepalwidth)
8.boxplot & stripplot(for sepallength and all species)
9.violinplot(for petallength and all species) 
10.pairplot(for all 4 columns with species)
